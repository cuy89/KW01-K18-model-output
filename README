This repository contains the axisymmetric and asymmetric K18 outputs used in the manuscript:
"Chau-Lam Yu, Anthony C. Didlake, Jr., Jeffrey D. Kepert and Fuqing Zhang: Investigating axisymmetric and asymmetric signals of secondary eyewall formation using observations-based modeling of the tropical cyclone boundary layer"
For bootstrapping experiments, only subset of the azimuthally averaged variables are stored, while for all other experiments full model data are stored.
